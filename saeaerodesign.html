  <h2>SAE Aero Design West 2025 – Micro Class</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>SAE Aero Design West</strong> is an international competition organized by <strong>SAE International</strong>, featuring three categories – Micro, Regular, and Advanced. The <strong>Micro Class</strong> challenges teams to design, build, and fly an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of maximizing payload capacity while minimizing overall weight and wingspan. The payload, consisting of liquid water, tests both the structural efficiency and flight performance of the UAV. Over <strong>70 teams</strong> from universities across the globe participated in the 2025 edition.

    As the <strong>Team Captain</strong>, I led a group of <strong>30+ students</strong> through the complete design and fabrication cycle of our UAV. I managed project timelines, coordinated subsystem teams, and oversaw the integration of aerodynamics, propulsion, and structural systems to ensure cohesive performance under competition constraints.

    Our UAV was designed for <strong>autonomous flight</strong> with a <strong>takeoff distance under 10 ft</strong> and operated within a strict <strong>450 W power limit</strong>. With a total empty weight of <strong>1.6 kg</strong>, the aircraft successfully carried a <strong>2 L liquid payload</strong>, achieving a payload fraction exceeding <strong>0.5</strong>. The optimized structural design ensured strength, safety, and quick assembly, while rigorous testing validated its aerodynamic efficiency and flight endurance of over <strong>5 minutes</strong>.

    The project combined advanced simulation, iterative prototyping, and data-driven testing to enhance flight stability and control. These efforts paid off as the team secured an impressive <strong>11th overall rank</strong> and <strong>5th place in mission score</strong> among more than seventy international competitors.
