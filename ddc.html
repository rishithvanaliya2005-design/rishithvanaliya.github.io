  <h2>Drone Design Challenge (DDC) Micro Class</h2>
  <p>
    The SAE Drone Development Challenge (DDC) is a national-level competition that challenges students to design, build, and demonstrate efficient unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of carrying payloads within strict dimensional and weight constraints.
    The <strong>Micro Class</strong> category emphasizes high payload fractions, compact design, and innovative engineering solutions. The event provides an excellent platform for students to apply aerodynamics, structural design, and systems engineering principles in a practical and competitive environment.

  <h3>DDC-Micro 2024 – Design Philosophy and Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    In the <strong>2024 edition</strong>, Team Arrow focused on developing a high payload fraction UAV that balanced lightweight construction with structural strength and aerodynamic efficiency.
    As the <strong>Design Lead</strong>, I guided the design process toward achieving maximum lift and stability while minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft.
    The team adopted a <strong>trailing edge tapered wing</strong> with a 1-meter span, reducing balsa usage and enhancing aerodynamic smoothness.
    A three-walled fuselage made of <strong>aeroply</strong> and <strong>flite board</strong> provided exceptional strength-to-weight performance, ensuring impact resistance and durability during repeated flight operations.

  <h4>Optimization and Flight Performance</h4>
  <p>
    Through iterative testing and refinement, the UAV’s empty weight was reduced from <strong>1000 grams to under 700 grams</strong>, achieving a remarkable <strong>payload fraction of 0.72</strong>.
    The simplified fuselage design made the UAV easier to manufacture, repair, and optimize between flights, nearly doubling the number of successful flight tests.
    A dedicated pilot training program ensured precision control, enabling consistent performance throughout testing and competition.
    The 2024 project reflected the team’s evolution toward a more data-driven, performance-oriented development cycle, marked by continuous improvement and engineering discipline.

  <h3>DDC-Micro 2023 – Stability and Structural Efficiency</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>2023 UAV</strong> focused on achieving high stability and efficient structural performance, with a strong emphasis on flight control and durability.
    The aircraft featured a <strong>cranked dihedral wing planform</strong>, which substantially improved roll stability and made the UAV easier to handle during turns and maneuvers.
    A <strong>squared semi-monocoque fuselage</strong> offered a lightweight yet impact-resistant structure, providing ample internal space for electronics and payload integration.
    To improve belly landing resilience, <strong>XPS foam</strong> was added to the underside, effectively absorbing shocks and protecting critical components.

  <h4>Optimization and Flight Performance</h4>
  <p>
    Throughout the 2023 development phase, the team continuously refined the UAV through experimentation and testing.
    The <strong>wing mounting system</strong> evolved from a slotted lock to a more reliable <strong>wing nut assembly</strong>, improving pre-flight efficiency and robustness.
    The use of <strong>aeroply shear webs</strong> in place of aluminum rods reduced overall weight while maintaining structural integrity.
    By optimizing aerodynamics and streamlining assembly, the team achieved significant gains in stability, performance, and operational reliability.
    These improvements laid the groundwork for the advanced lightweight strategies and design philosophies implemented in the 2024 UAV.
